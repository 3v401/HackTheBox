CrackMapExec (CME) is a tool used to automate tasks related to penetration testing within Windows network environments such as Active Directory.
It can interact with different network services such as SMB (Server Message Block), RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol),
WINRM (Windows Remote Management), and LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol). Some of its main applications are:

1. `Network Reconnaissance`: Enumerating network shares, users, groups, and policies within a Windows domain.
2. `Credential Testing`: Validating credentials and finding where they can be used within the network.
3. `Lateral Movement`: Executing commands on remote systems to move laterally within a network.
4. `Information Gathering`: Gathering detailed information about Active Directory objects and configurations.
5. `Post-Exploitation`: After gaining initial access, CME can help in maintaining access, further exploiting systems, and gathering data.

Observe that the open ports found with nmap where 80, 135, 139 and 445). Ports 139 and 445 are SMB ports. So it is a good way to start using CME to find SMB shares that allow applications to read and write files and request services from server programs in the computer network.
SMB can be a rich source of information if it is misconfigured, especially if shares are accessible to guest or unauthenticated users.
Also access to SMB shares might provide a foothold into the system, allowing you to upload or download files. This can be used to plant further exploits or gather more data for privilege escalation.
To install type `sudo apt install cme`.
